CS 3100: Data Structures and Algorithms 2
Foundation
(3 credits / Prerequisites: CS 2100 & CS 2120; APMA 1090 or MATH 1210 or MATH 1310 or equivalent)
Builds upon previous analysis of algorithms and the effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such as searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and machine learning. Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions.
